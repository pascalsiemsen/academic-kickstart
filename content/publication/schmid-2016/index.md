abstract: 'Healthcare financing involves varying distributive effects and builds on
  different concepts of solidarity. We suggest a set of indicators to explore equity
  issues in healthcare financing using aggregate spending and revenue data: the Index
  of Risk and Income Solidarity (IRIS). Contrary to established indicators, IRIS compares
  eleven OECD countries over four decades. In terms of risk solidarity we observe
  upward convergence. By contrast, the average and the variance of income solidarity
  remain fairly stable over time. The expected reform pattern of increasing risk solidarity
  and reduced income solidarity is only observed in the Netherlands and Switzerland.
  Yet, this reflects country-specific political compromises rather than assumptions
  about the effects of health spending growth and global competition on income solidarity.'
