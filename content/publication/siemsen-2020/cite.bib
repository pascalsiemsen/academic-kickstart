This observation is true for Poland as well. The far-right populist party Law and Justice (PiS, Prawo i Sprawiedliwoś\)́ won the parliamentary election in 2015. Next to the well-known nativist and populist messages, PiS promoted a social policy: the Family 500+ programme. Did this programme attract voters? The findings of this study lend reason to answer the question in the affirmative. The inclusion of social policies usually associated with left-wing parties might hence be a path to be explored by other far-right populist parties as well.$<$/p$><$/section$>$},
