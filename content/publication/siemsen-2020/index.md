abstract: '$<$section class=\"abstract\"$><$h2 class=\"abstractTitle text-title my-1\"
  id=\"d1673e2\"$>$Abstract$<$/h2$><$p$>$Populist, especially far-right populist,
  parties have gained votes in recent elections across Europe recently. This observation
  is true for Poland as well. The far-right populist party Law and Justice (PiS, Prawo
  i Sprawiedliwoś)́ won the parliamentary election in 2015. Next to the well-known
  nativist and populist messages, PiS promoted a social policy: the Family 500+ programme.
  Did this programme attract voters? The findings of this study lend reason to answer
  the question in the affirmative. The inclusion of social policies usually associated
  with left-wing parties might hence be a path to be explored by other far-right populist
  parties as well.$<$/p$><$/section$>$'
